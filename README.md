# For the Empire

## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. 

Currently there are a handful of bugs which are causing the tests to fail. 

Your task is to discover and fix these bugs, making the tests pass. 

This exercise will be completed in class.

## Storm Trooper Orders
* Storm Troopers have standing orders to call out to their fellow troopers every time they see a rebel
* Plot armor allows characters to escape after being spotted. Storm Troopers have standing orders to call out to their fellow troopers every time a rebel escapes
* Storm troopers have standing orders to shoot 4 times every time they see rebels, regardless of whether the rebels have escaped or not

## Tips

Use `mocha -w` to watch for changes for faster test iterations
